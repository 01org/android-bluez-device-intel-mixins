This is mixin configuration for BlueZ Bluetooth stack which may replace Broadcom's Bluedroid stack.

Steps to get started:

1. You need several extra packages (BlueZ, glib and sbc) which might be downloaded with local_manifest.xml

$ cd .repo
$ mkdir local_manifests
$ create local_manifest.xml
$ repo sync

2. Use the mixin with inherit-mixin. Following patch to device/intel/haswell enables BlueZ for Dell XPS12:

Note that patched bionic is needed for the time being untill we get latest updates from the bionic HEAD.

Then build and continue as before, everything should be working.
