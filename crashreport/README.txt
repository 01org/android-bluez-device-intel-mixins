Crash Report on ABT
--------------
Options:

ap_bp:   Enable crash report on both of application processor and modem chip.
ap_only: Enable crash report on application processor side only.
disable: Crash report is not included in target build.

Note:
Due to the lack of build support of Intel platforms that are shipped with IFX
modem, the "ap_bp" option is not tested. The default choice is linked to
"ap_only" accordingly.(3/Jan/2014)
